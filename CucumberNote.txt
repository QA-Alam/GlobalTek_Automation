What is the Cucumber?
Ans: Cucumber it’s self-framework where I can implement deferent approaches 
Examples: 
a.	BDD (Behavior Driven development)
b.	TDD (Test Driven development)
c.	ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven development)

I am flowing BDD approach -> Why?
Because of BDD focus on business logic, function and Behavior as well 
When I wrote the test cases with help of (gherkins) language which is a simple a country language any non-technical person easily can understand  

How to configure the cucumber in automation framework?
a.	I have to download software from eclipse marketplace (Cucumber and testNG)
https://rlogiacco.github.io/Natural

c.	I need dependencies from maven repo (https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central)

! Cucumber-Java 
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
    <version>6.11.0</version>
</dependency>
!! Cucumber-TestNG/J-unit
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
    <version>6.11.0</version>
</dependency>
!!! TestNG / Junit
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
    <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
    <version>6.14.3</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


What is the gherkin syntax?
Example:

Feature: (pre plan ->Valid users can buy, sale, return the product)
Description: (Optional – User story)
Background: (Common Step – Open browser, enter url, Username password etc…,) 
Scenario: Users can register the application) (Single Test case) Browser open only one time)
Scenario: Valid user can buy the product) 
Scenario: Valid user can sale the product) 
Scenario: Valid user can return the product)


Scenario Outline: Users cannot buy, sale, return the product with register (Multiple Test set) browser open multiple time based on the data table 

Example -> Login test -> Negative, Positive ,Boundary  

Examples: 
| Username | Password|
| alam            | alam123 |
|  egfe            | alam123 |
| alam            |3487358 | 
| alammdgd  | alam123 |
| alam             | shj53535|



Given -> pre – requisite (Open browser, url, maximize and many more…,
When -> All the Actions 
Then -> Validation  
And -> If I have any extra steps -> I am using And 


What are the Cucumber Options?

Strict
